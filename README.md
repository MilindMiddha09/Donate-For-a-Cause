# Donate-For-a-Cause
This project works as a database of donors who are willing to donate their blood plasmas to those patients who require it. All the details of the donors would be stored in a database by which it becomes easier for a patient to retrieve those details and contact the donor as per their requirements.

# Our Mission
•	Our mission is to connect the willing donors to the patients in a snap of time so that no patient dies due to the unavailability of donors.
•	Make a GUI based user interface so that it becomes easy for anyone to find willing donors
